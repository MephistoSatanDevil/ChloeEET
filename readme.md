style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Chloe is a female kensai NPC. She is romanceable by human, elven, and half-elven females (although Imoen must be in the party for the romance to succeed). If the PC is male or not interested in a romance or Chloe is not interested in a romance with the PC and Imoen is in the party, she will romance Imoen. Yes, as you may be pleased or shocked to hear, Chloe is a lesbian romance mod!

Chloe is found in the Air Pocket-Plane in Irenicus' Dungeon (and is not compatible with Dungeon-Be-Gone). She has a big added quest, special abilities, flirts and lovetalks. She banters with every Bioware NPC at least twice. Chloe does not push herself onto you, in absence of rejection. Chloe will only romance a PC that interests her, and the dialogue choice to increase her interest might not always be apparent. She is not guaranteed to remain with the player at the Tree of Life, and may decide that her life is more important than yours!
